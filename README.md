2. System Flow
        User Authentication & Authorization:
        Users access the landing page and log in via OAuth.
        JWT tokens are issued upon successful authentication.
API Gateway:
        API Gateway (Nginx/Kong) routes requests to appropriate microservices.
        It ensures secure and controlled access to the microservices.
Load Balancer:
        Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of microservices to ensure high availability and reliability.
Microservices:
        Each microservice (Grocery, Medicine, Flight, Loyalty Store) has its own database and handles its specific functionality.
        Services communicate with each other via the message broker (RabbitMQ).
Common Services:
        Handles cross-cutting concerns such as payment processing, loyalty wallet management, and customer support.
Data Management:
        Each microservice manages its own data using MongoDB.
        Caching with Redis/Memcached is used to improve performance.
Deployment & Monitoring:
        Services are containerized using Docker and orchestrated using Kubernetes.
        System health and performance are monitored using Prometheus.
        Logs are collected and analyzed using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
